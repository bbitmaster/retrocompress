WARNING! THIS PROGRAM DOES NOT YET WORK! IT IS EARLY WIP! DO NOT USE IT!


This is still very early/unfinished/unsupported. It doesn't work yet and has bugs.

This will eventually be a set of tools to compress and decompress data used by various first party SNES games.

It will use an algorithm similar to COMPRESCH - a tool wrote by disch in 2008. This algorithm is capable
(assuming it is implemented bug-free) of achieving optimal compression. I don't have any kind of formal proof
for this, but I know it to be true from my understanding of the algorithm.


Current Instructions:
There is no makefile yet. to compile run:
gcc snescompress.c -o snescompress
gcc dekirby.c -o dekirby

if you have a Kirby Adventure NES ROM named kirby.nes then run
./dekirby kirby.nes out.bin 0x1289d
to produce a file named out.bin with kirby level 1 decompressed data.

Once this file is produced, you can test the compressor by running
./snescompress out.bin out_compressed.bin
